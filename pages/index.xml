My passion is to inspire people to do their best work by automating manual and tedious workflows, and to make their best decisions by extracting insights from data and representing it in useful visualizations for data-driven decision making.
Before my studies, I worked as a data analyst at shopping24 in Hamburg for several years. There I gained experiences with building a company-wide data lake, making this data available in the form of insightful analyses and Tableau dashboards for all teams, and setting up Apache Airflow.</description></item></channel></rss>
